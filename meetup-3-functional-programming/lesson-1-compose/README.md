Before we look into composing functions, we should understand what pure functions are.

# Pure Functions
A function that do not have any side effects is termed pure function. A side effect can be a variable mutation outside the function, a console.log print, a network call, DOM manipulation or using Math.random() function.

Why? Because pure functions are:

* Easy to reason about
* Easy to combine
* Easy to refactor
* Easy to test
* Memoize
